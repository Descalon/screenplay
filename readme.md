    NARRATOR
    The biggest IT project the Dutch government has ever run, is on the brink of cancelation.

    Two days later, the Bureau of IT Review publishes a scathing report, becoming the final nail in this projects coffin.

    After 8 years of development, the Bureau accuses the program board of losing sight of the original goals. After raising the budget again and again, they advise parliament to stop the project.

    Which they do.

    This is the story of Operation BRP. Why did it fail? And why were the tensions this high?
